## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Clean code using SASS
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

HTML and CSS are not new to me at this point; however, JavaScript is what I find myself struggling for now. Gladly, this project made me feel pretty confident that I am on the right path of learning how to code.

Form Authentication is one of the most common task in JavaScript. Knowing how to build one inside and out is very crucial to fully understanding JavaScript. On this task, I learned how to:

- Create event listeners and attach them to a form.
- Create a function that allows me to validate user inputs.
- RegEx - to validate special rules in JS such as in the case of Email and Password.
- How to add classes to the HTML markup.
- How to use the logical ! NOT operator to simplify and present my code in a cleaner manner.
